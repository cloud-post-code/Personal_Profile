 * every page view — so the tab writes its own first draft and hands him a
 * filled-in form to edit.
 *
 * A draft is served to visitors immediately. That isn't a shortcut: it comes
 * from the same retrieval + persona prompt the chatbot would have used to
 * answer that exact question, so serving it is the same answer the visitor was
 * going to get — only instant and free. `aiDraft` marks it unreviewed for
 * Blake, and saving the row clears the mark.
 *
 * Each row is auto-drafted at most once, ever (`draftedAt`), so a row Blake
 * deliberately empties stays empty rather than refilling itself behind him.
 * Redrafting is a button, never a watcher.
