/**
 * The model exchange behind the ingestion-source builder chat: the admin
 * describes the source they want, the model replies conversationally AND
 * proposes a draft config the sample pane renders live. Data in, data out —
 * the split page and its test mode belong to app/admin/SourceBuilder.tsx.
 *
 * Parsing is defensive throughout: the model's output is admin-facing
 * suggestion, not trusted config. Non-JSON becomes a plain reply, fields
 * outside the closed vocabularies coerce to the safe defaults a custom
 * source wants (generic + text), and a draft without a label is no draft.
 * The final save still goes through saveIngestionSource's own validation.

const SYSTEM = `You help the admin of a personal site design a new INGESTION SOURCE:
a Content tab that ingests information for the site's chatbot. A source has:
- label: the tab's human name
- key: a short kebab-case slug derived from the label
- description: one line on what it ingests
- systemPrompt: the source's extraction lens. Splitting is AUTOMATIC — the
  pipeline splits every document/URL/paste into discrete items on its own,
  so never write "split this up" instructions. Instead describe what ONE
  ITEM is and which details it should carry (e.g. "one item per work
  initiative: name, owner, timeline, status").
- uploadMethod: one of ${UPLOAD_METHODS.join(", ")} — pick what fits how the
  content arrives: "url" scans web pages, "file" uploads PDF/Word documents,
  "textarea" is a paste-text form, "image" uploads photos, and "generic"
  offers paste + image together. ("resume"/"github"/"form" exist for the
  built-in tabs; avoid them for custom sources.)
- splitMode: "split" (default — the pipeline splits every document/URL/paste
  into one item per point) or "single" (each upload stays ONE item). Set
  "single" only when the admin says so ("keep each upload as one entry",
  "don't split these", "one card per document").
- panelHtml: OPTIONAL custom page code for the tab — plain HTML with inline
  CSS only, put {{items}} exactly where the ingested items should appear.
  No <script>, <form>, <iframe>, event handlers, or external resources;
  keep it under 40KB. Generate it ONLY when the admin asks for a custom
  layout or design ("make it look like a clippings board"); otherwise send
  "" — the default page is used. Refine the existing code when the admin
  asks for tweaks.
- storageKinds: one of ${STORAGE_KINDS.join(", ")} — every ingested piece is
  stored as text or as an image; default "text" unless images are wanted
- outputMethod: where the data lands; custom sources use
  "Source/Photo rows, read back as unified text/image items"

Answer EVERY turn as a single JSON object, nothing else:
{"reply": "<short conversational answer or question>",
 "draft": {<the full current config>} }
Refine the draft across turns from the whole conversation. If you still need
information before proposing anything, set "draft": null and ask in "reply".`;
