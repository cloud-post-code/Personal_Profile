/**
 * The agent's "facts card", in NANDA AgentFacts format.
 *
 * Honest framing, because the ecosystem here is young: AgentFacts is a research
 * proposal out of MIT (arXiv:2507.14263, marked "Work in Progress, Request for
 * Comments") with one published JSON Schema. It is not a ratified standard and
 * nobody validates it for you. What it is good for is being a single, stable,
 * human-and-machine-readable dossier — who runs this agent, what it can do, how
 * to reach it — that a person can link to and another agent can parse.
 *
 * So it is served from this domain rather than from a third-party registry:
 * self-hosted facts can't go stale behind your back, and a registry that shuts
 * down (as list39.org already has) takes its links with it.
 *
 * The fields we cannot honestly fill are left out. There is no `evaluations`
 * block because nothing here has been independently audited, and `certification`
 * says `self-declared` for the same reason — an unaudited agent claiming an
 * auditor is the failure mode this format exists to prevent.
