 * Who is allowed to talk to the agent, and how often.
 *
 * The endpoint is CLOSED. Every A2A call must present a bearer token matching
 * either `A2A_API_KEY` or the admin password — no credential, no answer. The
 * Agent Card still publishes, because that is how another agent learns this
 * one exists and that it needs credentials; publishing a card is not the same
 * as accepting anonymous work.
 *
 * Two things follow from accepting the admin password here:
 *
 *  1. The endpoint becomes an oracle for guessing that password, so failed
 *     attempts are throttled far harder than ordinary traffic (5 per 15
 *     minutes per IP) and every comparison is constant-time.
 *  2. Only the `Authorization` header is accepted — never the admin session
 *     cookie. A cookie-authenticated POST endpoint would be cross-site
 *     forgeable: any page Blake visits while logged in could spend his model
 *     credits. A bearer token has to be sent deliberately.
