 * are all generated from this catalogue.
 *
 * This used to be 21 labeled boxes drawn from two buyer-persona templates.
 * It's now one free-prose field: the templates asked for a lot of detail that
 * either isn't knowable about a real person or reads as padding in a prompt,
 * and a short true paragraph beats a long structured one. The catalogue shape
 * is kept so the storage format, the form, and the prompt stay driven from
 * one place — and so a second field can be added later without touching the
 * save path.
