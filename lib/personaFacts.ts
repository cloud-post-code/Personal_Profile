 * ── PERSONA → KNOWLEDGE ENTRIES ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The persona is one paragraph of prose, but it makes many separate claims:
 * what Blake builds, how he decides, what he distrusts, how he sounds. Indexed
 * whole it is a single blob that has to win a retrieval slot on the average of
 * everything it says. Split into one entry per claim, each is indexed on its
 * own — its own chunk, its own embedding, its own entity extraction — so a
 * question about one thing matches the sentence about that thing, and the
 * graph gets per-claim provenance instead of one edge owner called "Persona".
 *
 * This never changes what the chatbot is told about itself: the full paragraph
 * still ships verbatim in the always-on PERSONA block (lib/knowledge.ts). These
 * entries only affect what is retrievable and what the graph knows.
 *
 * Failure is always a downgrade, never an error: no key, a refusal, malformed
 * JSON, or a paragraph too short to split all return `[]`, and the caller
 * indexes the paragraph whole exactly as it did before this existed.
