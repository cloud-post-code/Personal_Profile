 * One sync pass: read sent mail newer than the cursor, fold it into contacts,

 *
 * The reader is an interface, not a Gmail client. That keeps the whole pass
 * provable with fixtures, and it means swapping the transport — IMAP against
 * the Sent folder, a Takeout mbox — is a new implementation of one method
 * rather than a rewrite here. Worth having: Google's docs do not settle
 * whether an unverified-but-Production app keeps a long-lived refresh token
 * for a restricted scope, so the transport may genuinely need to change.
