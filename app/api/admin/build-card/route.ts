 * chat route):
 *   {"t":"thinking","v":"..."}            incremental reasoning
 *   {"t":"search","query":"..."}          a knowledge search starting
 *   {"t":"searched","query":"…","hits":n} that search's result count
 *   {"t":"status","v":"..."}              a validation retry, etc.
 *   {"t":"draft","draft":{...}}           the finished card
 *   {"t":"error","v":"..."}               failure, as data
 *
 * Admin-only: the builder spends real tokens, so an unauthenticated request is
 * refused before any model call.
