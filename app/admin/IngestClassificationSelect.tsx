 * The "who is this for?" picker that sits on every ingest form. It differs
 * from ClassificationSelect (which sets a SOURCE's classification) in what it
 * means: this one classifies the ONE document being ingested, and its first
 * option is the source's own classification — so the default is chosen by
 * doing nothing, and an override is a deliberate act.
 *
 * The inherit option posts an empty value, which the server reads as "no
 * override": the item keeps following the source, including when the source's
 * classification later changes.
